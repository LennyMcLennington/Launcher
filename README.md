PolyMC 5
=========

PolyMC is a custom launcher for Minecraft that focuses on predictability, long term stability and simplicity.

## Disclaimers

This is a **fork** of [MultiMC](https://github.com/MultiMC/Launcher) and is not endorsed by the MultiMC project. The maintainer of MultiMC has been hostile to other people packaging it, and has taken an anti-user approach removing features from the software to make it harder to package for a system install. Therefore, this project was made to allow anyone to distribute this as they please, without needless obstructions that the MultiMC maintainer seems to deem necessary. Additionally, this allows for full-system installs, building from source (and you will be allowed support for your own builds), and for any redistribution you like--packages, binaries, whatever.

We simply do not agree with the MultiMC maintainer's attitude, and believe the source code should be provided not only for contribution purposes, but **for the user's freedom.** we believe that no program is truly "open source" if it is not Free Software. Peterix only open-sourced MultiMC because he wanted free code contributions. To quote him:

> The source is only provided for the purpose of collaboration.

This project is **not** endorsed by MultiMC. Peterix does not like anyone forking, let alone people forking for the purpose of user freedom, and has previously stated he disapproves of this fork.

## Packages
We currently don't have any packages available yet as this project has just been started, but we expect this to change very soon.

## Development
If you want to contribute, talk to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/multimc) first.

While blindly submitting PRs is definitely possible, they're not necessarily going to get accepted.

We aren't looking for flashy features, but expanding upon the existing feature set without distruption or endangering future viability of the project is OK.

### Building
If you want to build PolyMC yourself, check [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for build instructions.

### Code formatting
Just follow the existing formatting.

In general, in order of importance:
* Make sure your IDE is not messing up line endings or whitespace and avoid using linters.
* Prefer readability over dogma.
* Keep to the existing formatting.
* Indent with 4 space unless it's in a submodule.
* Keep lists (of arguments, parameters, initializers...) as lists, not paragraphs. It should either read from top to bottom, or left to right. Not both.
